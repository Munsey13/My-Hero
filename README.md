## How it works
* I have four image's that hold four random numbers between 1-12.
* I have another image that randomly generates a number between 19-120.
* A score checker that compares the totals to the computer generated number between 19-120.
* The score checker function checks if the total number was either over or matching. If it was over, you lose and it increases your lost count. If it's the same number, you win and the win count goes up. Each of these trigger a restart function that resets all the random numbers for you to play again.
